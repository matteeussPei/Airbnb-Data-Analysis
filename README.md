# Airbnb Data Analysis

The [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com.br/) is already considered to be the biggest hotel company today. Oh, and it doesn't own any hotels!

Connecting people who want to travel (and stay) with hosts who want to rent out their properties in a practical way, Airbnb provides an innovative platform to make this accommodation alternative.

By the end of 2018, the startup founded 10 years ago had already hosted more than 300 million people around the world, challenging traditional hotel chains.

It's possible to acquire and analyze data from Airbnb, made available by them at Inside Airbnb. It's a great source of data to be used in Data Science projects.
